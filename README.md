This project is API designed to provide content safety analysis for uploaded files, including images and text. It integrates with Azure AI Content Safety services to detect unsafe content, apply custom blocklists, and categorize content based on severity. The API supports image uploads, blocklist checking, and returns structured JSON results for both categories and blocklist matches.
